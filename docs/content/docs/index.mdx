import { Tab } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@/components/package-managers';

To get started with Toolsync, you can either use the [create command](/docs/reference/create) (described below) or install it manually. The create command is the recommended way to get started, as it will set up a new project with all the necessary configuration in no time. It works for both **new and existing projects**.

<Callout>We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) in the examples below.</Callout>

## Setup toolsync

<PackageManagerTabs>

<Tab value='pnpm'>
  
```shell
pnpm create @toolsync
```

</Tab>
<Tab value='npm'>

```shell
npm init @toolsync
```

</Tab>
<Tab value='yarn'>

```shell
yarn create @toolsync
```

</Tab>

</PackageManagerTabs>

The create command will prompt you for some options, such as what [built-in tools](/docs/builtin) to setup.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer, you can also [manually setup](/docs/guides/manual-setup) Toolsync in your project.

## Configure tools

Once you have set up Toolsync, you can configure it in the `toolsync.json` file in the root of your project. Continue to the [configuration page](/docs/configuration) to learn how.
