## Logging

You can configure logging via the `LOG_LEVEL` or `DEBUG` environment variables. This helps to better understand what Toolsync is doing, especially when something goes wrong.

### `$LOG_LEVEL`

You can use the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control how verbose logging should be:

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=debug <your command> # Enables debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=trace <your command> # Even more logging
```

> The log levels available are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal` and `silent`

### `$DEBUG`

If you want more granular debug logs use `DEBUG` instead

```shell
DEBUG=toolsync:* <your command> # Same as using `LOG_LEVEL=debug`
DEBUG=toolsync:cli:* <your command> # Enable debug logging just for the cli package
DEBUG=*:timing <your command> # Log timing
```
